Comments For Part 1:

Kaitlin’s Comments: krfong
- Commenting on kcmacint: Looks like it shares a lot of similarities with mine, I believe the role labels are missing from the Movie - recommends - Movie relationship 
- Commenting on spang1: Looks great, should movie attributes “title” and “year_of_prod” be underlined even though individually they can be repeated?
- Commenting on mrbhatt1: I’m confused about why “StreamingSession” has thick lines going toward both “HasSession” and “Watched” as I did mine differently. Also wondering why the relationships are in camel case

Kiernan's Comments: kcmacint
- Commenting on krfong: Looks great, dont know why there is watched and recommended between movie and recommends and follows should be outlined hard to sees
- Commenting on spang1: Looks good, I think there is arrows where there does not need to be and that they should just be regular lines 
- Commenting on mrbhatt1: Looks good, There should be attributes to streaming session though, and It has no need to be thick line, missing date and time and device used for streaming session attributes.


Mihir Bhatts Comments: mrbhatt1
- commenting on kcmaint: Only thing i notice is there is no double line between session and viewed but everything else seems to be about the same.
- Commenting on spang1: Wondering why Crew/Cast doesn't connect to Movies but otherwise everything else makes perfect sense
- Commenting on krfong: Looks a lot like mine, arrows and everything else similar too. Few minor differences though.
